# Portfolio: Desktop Version

## DOM manipulation
> In this project, use javascript DOM to implement the following changes: 
  - For each project you need to store the following pieces of data in a JavaScript object, at a minimum:   name, description, featured image, technologies, link to live version, link to source.
- You need to update the main page so that the projects section is created dynamically using the           information stored in that JavaScript object. Remember, all of the HTML in that section is created when the page loads.
- After that, you could implement the popup window.
